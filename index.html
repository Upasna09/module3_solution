            <h5 class="text-center">Chicken</h5>A chicken sandwich is a sandwich that typically consists of
            boneless, skinless
            chicken breast served between slices of bread, on a bun, or on a roll. Variations on the "chicken sandwich"
            include the chicken burger or chicken on a bun, hot chicken, and chicken salad sandwich.In North America,
            the sandwich usually consists of a chicken filet or patty, toppings and bread. The chicken meat can be deep
            fried, grilled, roasted or boiled, served hot or cold, and white or dark meat chicken can be used. Shredded
            chicken in one form or another, such as chicken salad, can also be used in chicken sandwiches. Another form
            is made with cold cuts. Wrap versions of the sandwich can also be made, in which the ingredients are rolled
            up inside a flatbread, such as a tortilla. Open-faced versions of the sandwich, which feature hot chicken
            served with gravy on top of bread, are also common variations.Chick-fil-A claims that it invented the fried
            chicken sandwich in the 1940s. This claim is unsubstantiated, though the Chick-fil-A southern-style chicken
            sandwich (served with pickles on a steamed roll), introduced on March 21, 1964, was most likely the first
            chicken sandwich introduced by a fast food restaurant chain. Other notable vendors of chicken sandwiches
            include KFC and Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen. Today, most major fast food, fast casual and casual dining chains
            feature some sort of chicken sandwich, even at restaurants where chicken is not a specialty.Chicken salad
            served between slices of bread is a chicken sandwich variation seen both in North America and elsewhere.</p>

            <h5 class="text-center">Beef</h5>This is a list of notable beef dishes and foods, whereby beef is used as a
            primary ingredient. Beef is the culinary name for meat from bovines, especially cattle. Beef can be
            harvested from cows, bulls, heifers or steers. Acceptability as a food source varies in different parts of
            the world. Beef is the third most widely consumed meat in the world, accounting for about 25% of meat
            production
            worldwide, after pork and poultry at 38% and 30% respectively. In absolute numbers, the United States,
            Brazil, and the People's Republic of China are the world's three largest consumers of beef. On a per capita
            basis in 2009, Argentines consumed the most beef at 64.6 kg per person; people in the U.S. ate 40.2 kg,
            while those in the E.U. ate 16.9 kg.

            <h5 class="text-center">Sushi</h5>
            Sushi is a traditional Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice, usually with some sugar and salt,
            accompanying a variety of ingredients, such
            as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key
            ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to as shari, or sumeshi.

            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or
            short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or
            imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari),
            wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.

            Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced
            raw fish or occasionally meat.
            The common ingredient in all types of sushi is vinegared sushi rice. Fillings, toppings, condiments, and
            preparation vary widely.

            Due to rendaku consonant mutation, sushi is pronounced with zu instead of su when a prefix is attached, as
            in nigirizushi.
            The increasing popularity of sushi around the world has resulted in variations typically found in the
            Western world, but rarely in Japan. A notable exception to this is the use of salmon. Historically, the
            Japanese have eaten salmon since prehistory; however, caught salmon in nature often contains parasites and
            must be cooked or cured for its lean meat to be edible - therefore, unsuitable as raw meat. On the other
            side of the world, in the 60s and 70s, Norwegian entrepreneurs started experimenting with Aquaculture
            farming. The big breakthrough was when they figured out how to raise salmon in net pens in the sea. Being
            farm raised, the Atlantic salmon showed advantages over the Pacific salmon, such as no parasites, easy
            animal capture and could be grown with higher fat content.
